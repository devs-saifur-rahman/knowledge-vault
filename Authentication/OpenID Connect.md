# OpenID Connect



The core of OpenID Connect is based on a concept called “ID Tokens.”

## Notes
* OpenID Connect’s ID Tokens take the form of a JWT (JSON Web Token), which is a JSON payload that is signed with the private key of the issuer, and can be parsed and verified by the application.
* OpenID Connect provides user identity and authentication on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. You can use OpenID Connect to establish a login session, and use OAuth to access protected resources.
